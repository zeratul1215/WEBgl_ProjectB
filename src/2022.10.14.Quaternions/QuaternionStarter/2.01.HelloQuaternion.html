Learning Activity
============================================================================
1)  Look in the 'lib' directory.  There you'll find the library file 
'cuon-matrix-quat03.js', an extended version of the book's rudimentary 
vector/matrix library ('cuon-matrix.js').  This updated version includes 
prototypes for quaternion objects, complete with supporting functions.

2) Explore the 'cuon-matrix-quat03.js' library.  In it you'll find objects 
'Vector3', 'Vector4' and 'Matrix4', which each have member functions to help 
you manipulate 3x1 vectors, 4x1 vectors and 4x4 matrices useful for 
computer graphics work, as well as a 'Quaternion' object we will now explore
for composing and interpolating rotations.  
But first,try out some basic vector/vector operations.
--Create two different Vector4 objects with nonzero elements.
--Compute and print their lengths in the console window. 
--Can any Vector4 member function compute that for you?  
--Should you add a new member fcn?  
--How can you normalize these vectors?
--Can you compute a 'dotProduct()' for two Vector4 objects?  
(Note that some of the code within other functions computes dot products); Wouldn't it be nice to have a Vector4 member function to do this?  
Try to make one; did it work? test it...
--Can you compute a 'crossProduct()' for two Vector4 objects? 
Can you find a Vector4 member function to do this? Can you make one? Did it work?>

3) Make some simple quaternions for testing; compare your results to those 
you create for same 3D axis+angles using this on-line quaternion calculator:
     http://www.energid.com/resources/orientation-calculator/ 

For example, create these quaternions:
--q0: a LONG Quaternion (magnitude larger than 1) that rotates by +30 degrees around +X axis
--q1: a SHORT Quaternion (magnitude less than 1) that rotates by -45 degrees around the +Z axis
--q2: a Quaternion that rotates by +90 degrees around the (1,1,1) axis
--'Normalize' each of these quaternions and print them on-screen.

4) Convert q0 and q1 to rotation matrices R0 and R1.
   Do they agree with our online calculator?

5) Use Matrix4.concatenate() function (does 4x4 matrix multiply) to make two
new matrices by multiplying R0 and R1:
	[R01] = [R0][R1]  and 
	[R10] = [R1][R0]
>
<!
6) Similarly, use quaternion multiply function to make two new quaternions by
multiplying q0 and q1:
q01 = q0*q1 and q10 = q1*q0.
--Convert q01 and q10 to rotation matrices;  
   Do these match the online calculator's results?
   Which quaternions (q10 or q10) yields a rotation matrix that matches R01? R10? Why?
